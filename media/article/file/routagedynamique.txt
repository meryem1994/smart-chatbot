What Does Dynamic Routing Mean?Dynamic routing is a networking technique that provides optimal data routing. Unlike static routing, dynamic routing enables routers to select paths according to real-time logical network layout changes. In dynamic routing, the routing protocol operating on the router is responsible for the creation, maintenance and updating of the dynamic routing table. In static routing, all these jobs are manually done by the system administrator.Dynamic routing uses multiple algorithms and protocols. The most popular are Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF).
Techopedia Explains Dynamic RoutingThe cost of routing is a critical factor for all organizations. The least-expensive routing technology is provided by dynamic routing, which automates table changes and provides the best paths for data transmission.Typically, dynamic routing protocol operations can be explained as follows:The router delivers and receives the routing messages on the router interfaces.
The routing messages and information are shared with other routers, which use exactly the same routing protocol.Routers swap the routing information to discover data about remote networks. Whenever a router finds a change in topology, the routing protocol advertises this topology change to other routers.Dynamic routing is easy to configure on large networks and is more intuitive at selecting the best route, detecting route changes and discovering remote networks. However, because routers share updates, they consume more bandwidth than in static routing; the routers' CPUs and RAM may also face additional loads as a result of routing protocols. Finally, dynamic routing is less secure than static routing.

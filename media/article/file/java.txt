Java is a class-based object-oriented simple programming language. Though we can not consider it to be fully object-oriented as it supports primitive datatypes. It is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that helps programmers and developers to write a code once and run it anywhere.Java is considered both a compiled and interpreted language. It is because Java source code is first compiled to bytecode which is then interpreted by Java Virtual Machine. Java Virtual Machine interprets the bytecode and converts it to platform specific machine code. Hence, Java is also called a platform-independent programming language.
Java is a programming language that James Gosling developed at Sun Microsystems_Inc in the year 1995, which later on was taken into possession by the Oracle Corporation in 2009.We can call it a high-level (makes the development of programs easy and much more user-friendly) programming language which makes it very convenient for us to write, compile and debug Java programs.Java is a class-based object-oriented programming language that implements the principle of write once code anywhere.Since Java applications are compiled to byte-code, they can run on any JVM-supported machine.Java codes are very similar to C/C++, which makes them easier to understand.Letâ€™s further look into this and read a few more facts about Java.
